# IceGrabber##### A python automated tool to file organizationIceGrabber is a python tool that automatically moves and organizes files based on the configuration set on your xml file. It can easily set up a Project by creating the folder strucuture and moving the files or even saving your time by organizing your folders automatically.### How it works##### Directory structure creation IceGrabber uses a configuration file(currently only xml is supported), which is by default named [**orgstructure.xml**](https://github.com/VirtualIceShard/IceGrabber/blob/master/orgstructure.xml). Based on this, IceGrabber checks if the directories listed in the configuration file exist and if not then IceGrabber creates then. The directories are created based on the root direcotory, whic is by default the directory where IceGrabber is being executed.###### Note: once you create an instance of IceGrabber, keep in mind that the steps above will only be executed the first time you execute the method `organize()`. This happens because we want to support applications that use Threads to keep organizing files, and executing the directory check everytime would result in a bad performance. If you want to check the directories too, inoke the method `check_dirs()` before invoking `oragnize()`.&nbsp;##### File organizationAfter checking the folder structure, IceGrabber starts organizing the files based on the file-orientation from the configuration file. The first attribute to be checked is the file type, which is defined in the `<for>` tag, or _file-orientati_. If the file type corresponds to the indicated, then the file is checked on the `<sor>` childs, which are _sub-orientations_. There are various categories to check a file, all of them are listed below:- FileTypeSpecification (the file has type has been checked before, so this means a `True` if checked)- PrefixSpecification - Checks the file prefix declared in the `spec` attribute- SufixSpecification - Checks the file sufix declared in the `spec` attribute- PrefixAndSufixSpecification - Checks the file prefix and sufix declared in the `spec` attribute, separed by one `$` characters with two `_` characters around (e.g.: index`_$_`-2.0)- FullNameSpecification - Checks the file by it's name declared in the `spec` attribute.
